# Twililing (HackRUFall2019)

# Description:
Job finder without having to download anything. Doesn't consume phone storage nor data. All you need is phone signal.

### E.g. Computer Science, 07208
# IMPORTANT !! Might not work with non-verified numbers because Twilio doesn't give trial accounts anymore. But once the message is receieved from the web app, I will allow your number to access the app.  

## Steps on how to use it:
* Text the number +1 (908) 460-7660
* Then the message --> Job field, zip code, !optional (see Optional section below)  
!! IMPORTANT - must be separted by comma space ", "


### E.g.  " Computer Science, 07208 "
<img src="screenshot/screenshot1.jpg" alt="alt text" width="414" height="776">  


### Optional  
The third parameter is optional, it is for urgency options.  
Set to true if you're looking for companies who are urgently hiring (good for people who needs a job or money ASAP)  
Set to false if not (This is default, so you don't need to specify the third parameter)
