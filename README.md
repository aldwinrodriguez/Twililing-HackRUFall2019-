* Then the message --> Job field, zip code, !optional (see Optional section below)  
!! IMPORTANT - must be separted by comma space ", "

### E.g.  " Computer Science, 07208 "
<img src="screenshots/screenshot1.jpg" alt="alt text" width="540" height="700">  


### Optional  
The third parameter is optional, it is for urgency options.  
Set to true if you're looking for companies who are urgently hiring (good for people who needs a job or money ASAP)  
Set to false if not (This is default, so you don't need to specify the third parameter)
